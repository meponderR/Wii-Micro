# Wii-Micro
Me &amp; my friend's first Wii hardmod

## Why is this useful?
The Wii was a very population sytem when it was released. However the wii being a fairly large console instead of a smaller plug 'n' play limits the portability. This project seeks to solve the portability problem with the wii by having a smaller chassis.
